I work for [Tesla Inc](https://www.tesla.com).
I hold a PhD in 
[Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu)
from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu)
and a BChE in [chemical engineering](https://cbe.udel.edu)
from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu).
[My graduate research](/research) focused on making lithium-ion batteries last longer
and charge faster through combining fundamental understanding and data-driven methods.

My primary research interest is **building systems that save people time**.
I'm especially interested in
[accelerating scientific progress through automation](/articles/2017/09/18/automating-science.html).
To combat climate change, we need to accelerate the development
of alternative energy technologies so that they're available in years, rather than decades.
While my background is in the physical sciences,
I've developed skills in software engineering and machine learning
to create platforms for autonomous scientific research.

Some personal tidbits about me can be found [here](/personal).

This is my personal website.

### Which Peter Attia are you?

Seeing how my website barely cracks the top 10 pages of a Google search for
"Peter Attia", the Peter Attias of this world are doing quite well! The good
news is I'm in good company; the bad news is it can be difficult to find me via
online (hence the "m" in [peter**m**attia.com](https://petermattia.com)).

In particular, two identically-named gentlemen have a larger web presence than I.
I'm not [Peter Attia, M.D.](http://eatingacademy.com/dr-peter-attia),
although we both went to Stanford after studying engineering as an undergraduate.
I'm also not [this Peter Attia](https://twitter.com/peterattia),
who works on search engine optimization.
