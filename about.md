### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I am a fourth-year PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford
University.
[My research](/research) focuses on making lithium-ion batteries last longer
and charge faster.


I graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Chemical
Engineering in 2014. I loved my time at UD as a Fightin' Blue Hen -
I particularly enjoyed driving a Zamboni....

[Lastly, I'm getting married!](https://withjoy.com/toripluspete)

### Which Peter Attia are you?

Seeing how my website barely cracks the top 10 pages of a Google search for
'Peter Attia', the Peter Attias of this world are doing quite well! The good
news is I'm in good company; the bad news is it can be difficult to find me via
online (hence the 'm' in [peter**m**attia.com](http://www.petermattia.com)).

In particular, two identically-named gentlemen have a much larger web presence than I.
I'm not [Peter Attia, M.D.](http://eatingacademy.com/dr-peter-attia),
although we both went to Stanford after studying engineering as an undergraduate
(although that's about where the similarities end). I'm also not the Peter Attia
of [www.cucumbernebula.com](http://www.cucumbernebula.com/peter-attia/),
who works on search engine optimization. I don't envy him - Peter Attia, M.D.
is steep competition on Google!
