I am a fourth-year PhD student in
[Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu)
at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu).
[My research](/research) focuses on making lithium-ion batteries last longer
and charge faster.
Prior to Stanford,
I graduated from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu)
with a degree in [chemical engineering](https://www.cbe.udel.edu).

One of the many things I've learned in grad school so far is that I like science,
but I love engineering - specifically, **building systems that save people time**.
I'm especially interested in
[accelerating scientific progress through automation](/articles/2017/09/18/automating-science.html).
While my background is in the physical sciences,
I'm developing skills in data science and software engineering
to create platforms for autonomous scientific research.

This website serves as a collection of software projects,
data science explorations, electrochemistry tutorials,
and musings about batteries. I create stuff mostly for myself -
putting it online keeps me honest.
Since you're here, I hope my content informs or amuses you.
Feel free to reach out!

### Which Peter Attia are you?

Seeing how my website barely cracks the top 10 pages of a Google search for
'Peter Attia', the Peter Attias of this world are doing quite well! The good
news is I'm in good company; the bad news is it can be difficult to find me via
online (hence the 'm' in [peter**m**attia.com](http://www.petermattia.com)).

In particular, two identically-named gentlemen have a much larger web presence than I.
I'm not [Peter Attia, M.D.](http://eatingacademy.com/dr-peter-attia),
although we both went to Stanford after studying engineering as an undergraduate
(although that's about where the similarities end). I'm also not the Peter Attia
of [www.cucumbernebula.com](http://www.cucumbernebula.com/peter-attia/),
who works on search engine optimization. I don't envy him - Peter Attia, M.D.
is steep competition on Google!
