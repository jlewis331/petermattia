### Marriage

My most exciting "personal" item is that I'm
[recently married](https://player.vimeo.com/video/252820064)!
Victoria is genuine, kind, passionate, and quite the looker,
and I'm beyond excited to spend the rest of my life with her.

I enjoy playing pickup basketball, biking and hiking around the Bay Area,
eating and cooking good food,
and watching the Philadelphia Eagles
~~have promising regular seasons and then break my heart in the playoffs~~
WIN THE SUPER BOWL!

### Delaware

<p>

</p>

I have what some might call an irrational love for my home state of Delaware.
Fun facts about Delaware:
- 1<sup>st</sup> state to ratify the Constitution
- 49<sup>th</sup> largest state based on geographic area
- [60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the state](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html)
- No sales tax!

Famous Delawareans include:
- Super Bowl quarterbacks
  [Joe Flacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco)
  and [Rich Gannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Gannon)
- [Henry Heimlich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Heimlich), of Heimlich maneuver fame
- [Dr. Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz)
- [Bob Marley](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/07/05/delaware-backstory-lovin-bob-marley/29753145/)
- [Ryan Phillippe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Phillippe)
- And, of course,
[Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden),
our former Vice President

As a [Fightin' Blue Hen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Fightin%27_Blue_Hens#Nickname)
at the University of Delaware,
I was a proud member of one of intercollegiate athletics' least intimidating mascots
(rivaled only, perhaps, by the [Stanford Cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal)).
Delaware's only professional sports team,
[the Wilmington Blue Rocks](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t426), might take the cake though.

Delaware is also home to:
- [The 9th-best ice cream in America](https://ir.tripadvisor.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=927029)
- [The Punkin Chunkin World Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_chucking)
- [A huge music festival](https://fireflyfestival.com)
- [Some really beautiful beaches](https://www.visitdelaware.com/things-to-do/beaches/)

We're also less than three hours from Philly, Baltimore, DC, and New York.

### Heritage

<p>
<img src="/img/personal/complexion.JPG" style="width=100px;display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</p>

My olive complexion, hard-to-place facial features,
and vaguely-foreign last name make me ethnically ambiguous -
in approximate order of frequency, people have assumed I'm from
Greece, Iran, Brazil, India, Italy, Mexico, South Africa, China (???),
and many, many other countries.

In fact, I'm 100% Egyptian.
My mom was born there and moved to the US as an infant,
and my dad moved here in his 20s - which makes me 1.5 generation American,
[I think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_generations).

### 50 states

One of my life goals is to visit all 50 states.
Check out my progress [here](/50states).

### Work

<p>
<img src="/img/personal/zamboni.png" alt="Zamboni" style="width: 300px;display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</p>

I take pride in the fact that I have worked a part-time job nearly continuously
since I was 14, introducing me to all sorts of different people.
I've worked as a supermarket bagboy and cashier, a file clerk in a law firm,
a landscaping manager, an app developer, and a college tutor.
My most eclectic job to date, however, would be driving a Zamboni.
I will always remember my two years at the
[University of Delaware Ice Arenas](https://www.udel.edu/icearena/) -
there's nothing quite like cutting ice while high-riving wide-eyed kids or,
more vividly, riding a jammed Zamboni that is violently spitting
basketball-sized chunks of ice in seemingly impossible directions
while making terrific gurgling and hissing sounds at 2 AM in an empty ice rink.

### UrbanPromise

<p>
<img src="/img/personal/UP.jpg" alt="UrbanPromise" style="width: 300px; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</p>

[UrbanPromise Wilmington](https://www.urbanpromise.org/) will always have a
special place in my heart - and not only because I met my wife there.
UrbanPromise runs free summer camps and after-school programs for the children of Wilmington.
Because it hires local teens to help lead camp, UrbanPromise is the largest employer of Wilmington youth.
As a social service, programs like UrbanPromise are badly needed in Wilmington,
a [dangerous](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/03/27/report-wilmington-dangerous-small-city-country/) and [unforgiving](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/26/mother-confronts-sons-killer-court/14624211/) place to live,
but UrbanPromise's success lies not in its academic enrichment
or job training programs (both of which are very good!);
rather, it comes from a [deep dependence on God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A11&version=NIV).

I know for a fact that UrbanPromise's emphasis on
[forgiveness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-22&version=NIV)
has saved lives.
As a Christian, few experiences have grown my understanding of
[faith, hope, and love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13:13)
like UrbanPromise - faith in God's power, hope for God's kingdom, and love
for God's people.
I loved working with the high school and the summer camp and
to witness [God's transformational power](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=NIV).
I would encourage anyone with a free summer and a desire to glimpse the
[body of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A3-8&version=NIV)
in action to serve as an [intern](https://www.urbanpromise.org/programs/interns).
