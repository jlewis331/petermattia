### Hobbies

Desean Jackson dropping the ball
I enjoy playing pickup basketball, reading, and watching the Philadelphia Eagles
have promising regular seasons and then break my heart in the playoffs.

### Delaware
Joe Biden
I have an irrational love for my home state of Delaware.
Fun facts about Delaware: it was the 1st state to ratify the Constitution;
it is the 49th largest state, based on geographic area;
as [the corporate capital of America](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),
60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the state;
and there is no sales tax.
Famous Delawareans include Joe Flacco and Rich Gannon,
two recent Super Bowl quarterbacks; Henry Heimlich, of Heimlich maneuver fame;
Dr. Oz; Ryan Phillippe; and, of course,
Joe Biden, our gaffe-prone VP ([and a favorite of The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/channels/joseph-biden/)).
You can check out more Delaware facts [here](http://www.movoto.com/de/delaware-facts/).

As a Fightin' Blue Hen at the University of Delaware,
I was a proud member of one of intercollegiate athletics' least intimidating mascots
(rivaled only, perhaps, by the Stanford Cardinal).
Delaware's only professional sports team,
[the Wilmington Blue Rocks](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t426), might take the cake though.

Contrary to popular belief, Delawareans know how to have a good time. We're home to the 4th-best ice cream in America, the Punkin Chunkin World Championship, a huge music festival and some really beautiful beaches. If city life is your thing, we're less than three hours from Philly, Baltimore, DC, and New York. For me, Delaware will always be home.

### Work
zamboni
I take pride in the fact that I have worked a part-time job nearly continuously
since I was 14, introducing me to all sorts of different people.
I've worked as a supermarket bagboy and cashier, a file clerk in a law firm,
a landscaping manager, an app developer, and a college tutor.
The job that typically attracts the most attention, however,
is Zamboni driver. I will always remember my two years at
the [University of Delaware Ice Arenas](http://www.udel.edu/icearena/) -
there's nothing quite like cutting ice while high-riving wide-eyed kids or,
more vividly, riding a jammed Zamboni that is violently spitting
basketball-sized chunks of ice in seemingly impossible directions
while making terrific gurgling and hissing sounds at 2 AM in an empty ice rink.



### UrbanPromise

UrbanPromise
[UrbanPromise Wilmington](http://www.urbanpromise.org/) will always have a
special place in my heart.
UrbanPromise runs free summer camps and after-school programs for the children of Wilmington.
Because it hires local teens to help lead camp, UrbanPromise is the largest employer of Wilmington youth.
As a social service, programs like UrbanPromise are badly needed in Wilmington,
an incredibly [dangerous](http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/03/27/report-wilmington-dangerous-small-city-country/) and [unforgiving](http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/26/mother-confronts-sons-killer-court/14624211/) place to live,
but UrbanPromise's success lies not in its academic enrichment
or job training programs (both of which are very good!);
rather, it comes from a [deep dependence on God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A11&version=NIV).

I know for a fact that UrbanPromise's emphasis on
[forgiveness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-22&version=NIV)
has saved lives.
As a Christian, nothing has grown my understanding of
[faith, hope, and love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13:13)
like UrbanPromise - faith in God's power, hope for God's kingdom, and love
for God's people.
It has been a true joy to work with the high school and the summer camp and
to witness [God's transformational power](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=NIV).
I would encourage anyone with a free summer and a desire to glimpse the
[body of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A3-8&version=NIV)
and Martin Luther King Jr.'s
["God-intoxication"](http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
to serve as an [intern](https://www.urbanpromise.org/programs/interns).
