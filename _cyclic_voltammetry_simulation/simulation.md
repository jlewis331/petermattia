## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

In this post, I'll explain the cyclic voltammetry simulation I've created in
greater detail. You can find the full MATLAB script file
[here](/cyclic_voltammetry_simulation/code.html).

Again, this simulation is well-described in Bard and Faulkner, Appendix B.
Highly recommended for all the details.
This walkthrough is designed to serve as a "practical" guide to performing these
simulations, as well as to make Bard and Faulkner's
occasionally dense writing style more accessible.

### Set independent variables

~~~~matlab
%%% INDEPENDENT VARIABLES %%%
C      = 1.0;   % [=] mol/cm^3, initial concentration of O. Default = 1.0
D      = 1E-5;  % [=] cm^2/s, O & R diffusion coefficient. Default = 1E-5
etai   = +0.2;  % [=] V, initial overpotential (relative to redox potential). Default = +0.2
etaf   = -0.2;  % [=] V, final overpotential (relative to redox potential). Default = -0.2
v      = 1E-3;  % [=] V/s, sweep rate. Default = 1E-3
n      = 1.0;   % [=] number of electrons transfered. Default = 1
alpha  = 0.5;   % [=] dimensionless charge-transfer coefficient. Default = 0.5
k0     = 0.01;  % [=] cm/s, electrochemical rate constant. Default = 1E-2
k1     = 0;    % [=] 1/s, chemical rate constant. Default = 0
~~~~

These variables are the "adjustable" parameters in this simulation.
These parameters should be straightforward to someone interested in cyclic
voltammetry simulations. I'll note that $ k_0 $ is the electrochemical rate constant,
with units of $ \text{cm/s} $ , and $ k_1 $ is the chemical rate constant,
with units of $ \text{1/s} $.
You can read more about these terms on the
[fundamentals](/cyclic_voltammetry_simulation/fundamentals.html) page.

### Set physical constants

~~~~matlab
%%% CONSTANTS %%%
F      = 96485;   % [=] C/mol, Faraday's constant
R      = 8.3145;  % [=] J/mol-K, ideal gas constant
T      = 298.15;  % [=] K, temperature. Default = 298.15
f      = F/(R*T); % [=] 1/V, normalized Faraday's constant at room temperature
~~~~

These variables are fundamental physical constants.
The [Faraday constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_constant)
is often normalized by $ RT $.

In my work, I don't consider temperatures other than room temperature.
If your work involves variable temperature, you can move $ T $ from "constants"
to "independent variables".

### Set simulation variables

~~~~matlab
%%% SIMULATION VARIABLES %%%
L      = 500;    % [=] number of iterations per t_k (pg 790). Default = 500
DM     = 0.45;   % [=] model diffusion coefficient (pg 788). Default = 0.45
~~~~

$ L $ and $ D_M $ are two intrinsic simulation variables.

$ L $ is the *number of timesteps* in our simulation.
Our experiment will take some amount of real time ($ t_k $, as discussed below).
For a trivial example, if our experiment sweeps from $ +1 \text{V} $ to
$ -1 \text{V} $ at a rate of $ 1 \text{ V/s} $, we are simulating a total
time of $ 4\text{ s} $. If $ L = 500 $, each timestep will be
$ 4000 \text{ ms / } 500 = 8 \text{ ms} $.

Two notes on $ L $:
- $ L $ controls the resolution of our experiment. A low value of $ L $ will
  lead to "choppiness" in the output; a high value of $ L $ is computationally
  expensive. Bard and Faulkner recommend $ L $ to be between 100 and 1000.
  However, "computationally expensive" in 2001 (the publication year
  of Bard and Faulkner) is different than "computationally expensive" in 2017.
  My 2014 MacBook Air ran this simulation with $ L = 10000 $ in 0.4s.
  This simulation is an analytical form of a set of differential equations,
  so it's already computationally inexpensive.
  In my experience, $ L = 500 $ produces smooth curves.
- Changing $ L $ will change the magnitude of dimensionless current, so don't
  change $ L $ when comparing two simulations - unless, of course, you're
  interested in understanding the effect of $ L $ ðŸ˜‰.

$ D_M $ is the *model diffusion coefficient*.
$ D_M $ is defined as $ D\Delta t / \Delta x^2 $.
A "model diffusion coefficient" is used to ensure that one implicit
assumption is satisfied: within a single timestep, material can only diffuse
between nearest-neighbor boxes.
If $ \delta x $ is too small for a given $ \delta t $, the simulation becomes
unphysical. For example, if $ D_M = 0.5 $, a mass-transfer operation between a
full box and an empty box will leave both boxes half-full, which violates
Fick's laws.
Thus, we must satisfy the condition that $ D_M < 0.5 $.
Bard and Faulkner recommend $ D_M = 0.45 $, which we retain here.

### Calculate derived constants

~~~~matlab
%%% DERIVED CONSTANTS %%%
j      = ceil(4.2*L^0.5)+5;   % [=] number of boxes (pg 792-793). If L~200, j=65
Deta   = etai-etaf;           % [=] V, voltage range of one scan (pg 790)
tk     = 2*Deta/v;            % [=] s, characteristic exp. time (pg 790). In this case, total time of fwd and rev scans
Dt     = tk/L;                % [=] s, delta time (Eqn B.1.10, pg 790)
Dx     = sqrt(D*Dt/DM);       % [=] cm, delta x (Eqn B.1.13, pg 791)
ktk    = k1*tk;               % [=] dimensionless kinetic parameter (Eqn B.3.7, pg 797)
km     = ktk/L;               % [=] normalized dimensionless kinetic parameter (see bottom of pg 797)
Lambda = k0/(D*f*v)^0.5;      % [=] dimensionless reversibility parameter (Eqn 6.4.4, pg. 236-239)
~~~~

This section shows the derived constants. I'll walk through each of them
individually:
- $ j $ (`j`) is the number of 'finite elements', or 'boxes'. We can calculate
  the number of boxes required by estimating the diffusion layer length, in
  units of boxes. 3D diffusion proceeds as $ 6(Dt)^{0.5} $. In units of 'boxes',
  we need $ j_{max} = 6(Dt)^{1/2}/\Delta x + 1 $. With some algebra, we find
  that $ j_{max} < 4.2 L^{1/2} $. I added the `+5` since it can't hurt.
- $ \Delta \eta $ (`Deta`) is the total voltage range of a scan in
  [one direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction)
- $ t_k $ (`tk`) is the total experiment time, or a "characteristic experimental
  duration"
- $ \Delta t $ (`dt`) is the size of each timestep, given the total experiment
  time and the number of timesteps we desire, $ L $
- $ \Delta x $ (`dx`) is the width of each box. It's controlled by $ D_M $, as
  discussed above.
- $ k_1 t_k $ (`ktk`) is the dimensionless kinetic parameter. Specifically, it
  is the dimensionless *chemical* kinetic parameter, capturing the effect of
  the $R \overset{k_c}{\rightarrow} Z $ reaction.
  $ k_1 t_k $ controls the extent of chemical reversibility.
  I will discuss what this means in a seperate post.
- $ k_m $ (`km`) is the normalized dimensionless kinetic parameter. This value
  is convenient in future calculations.
- $ \Lambda $ (`Lambda`) is the dimensionless electrochemical reversibility
  parameter. It's an indicator of the balance between charge-transfer and
  mass-transfer rates. I'll do a follow-up post on chemical and electrochemical
  reversibility soon.

### Warn user about issues

~~~~matlab
if km>0.1
    warning(['k_c*t_k/l equals ' num2str(km) ...
        ', which exceeds the upper limit of 0.1 (see B&F, pg 797)'])
end
~~~~

In my experience, this simulation only breaks under one well-documented condition,
which is addressed by Bard and Faulkner (pg 797).
One limitation of the choice of a finite-element model is a breakdown of the
approximation at extreme conditions.
In this case, if $ k_1 $ is too large, the chemical reaction term dominates
over the electrochemical reaction and diffusion terms.
According to the text, the limit is $ k_1 t_k/L > 0.1 $.
My code warns you about this, but allows you to proceed.
If you see infinite currents, it's probably from this error.

### Pre-initialize variables

Almost there. The next section is mostly pre-initialization:
~~~~matlab
%%% PRE-INITIALIZATION %%%
k = 0:L;
t = Dt * k;
eta1 = etai - v*t; % negative scan
eta2 = etaf + v*t; % positive scan
eta = [eta1(eta1>etaf) eta2(eta2<=etai)]'; % eta includes both fwd and rev
Enorm = eta*f;
kf = ( k0*tk*exp(  -alpha *n*Enorm) )./( sqrt(DM*L)*Dx );
kb = ( k0*tk*exp((1-alpha)*n*Enorm) )./( sqrt(DM*L)*Dx );

O = C*ones(L+1,j); % Initial concentrations of O
R = zeros(L+1,j);  % Initial concentrations of R
Z = zeros(L+1,1);  % Dimensionless current
~~~~

Again, I'll walk through the variables:
- $ k $ (`k`) is the time index. `k` is a vector
- $ t $ (`t`) is the simulation step time. `t` is a vector
- $ \eta_1 $ (`eta1`) and $ \eta_2 $ (`eta2`) combine to form $ \eta $ (`eta`),
  which is a vector of the overpotential. We plot `eta` at the end.
- $ E_{norm} $ (`Enorm`) is the dimensionless overpotential. This form is
  convenient for Butler-Volmer expressions.
- $ k_f $ (`k_f`) and $ k_b $ (`k_b`) are the forward and reverse rate constants,
   given by the [Butler-Volmer equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butlerâ€“Volmer_equation).
- `O` and `R` are the initial concentrations of $ O $ and $ R $, respectively.
  The initial concentration of $ O $ is $ C $, and the initial concentration
  of $ R $ is $ 0 $.
  The `O` and `R` arrays have $ L + 1 $ columns (time steps)
  and $ j $ rows (length steps).
- `Z` is the dimensionless current, which we'll plot at the end.
  We need $ L + 1 $ columns (time steps).

### Run main simulation

We'll now calculate the current at $ k = t = 0 $:

~~~~matlab
% First dimensionless current (pg 792)
Z(1) = ( kf(1)*O(1,2) - kb(1)*R(1,2) ) ./ (1 + kf(1) + kb(1));
~~~~

We can calculate this current directly since the concentrations at
$ k = t = 0 $ are defined.

### TODO

The equation we use for dimensionless current is:

$$ Z(k) = \frac{k_f(k)O(k,2) - k_r(k)R(k,2)}{1 + k_f(k) + k_r(k)} $$

That's a lot of $ k $'s! What this equation is saying is ___.

And finally, the bulk of the simulation. We cycle through all possible times;
within each timestep, we cycle through all lengths.

~~~~matlab
%%% START SIMULATION %%%
% k = time index. j = distance index
for i1 = 2:length(k)
    % Update surface concentrations
    Z(i1)   = ( kf(i1).*O(i1,2) - kb(i1).*R(i1,2) ) ./ (1 + kf(i1) + kb(i1));
    O(i1,1) = O(i1,2) - Z(i1) + km*R(i1-1,1);
    R(i1,1) = R(i1,2) + Z(i1) - km*R(i1-1,1);

    % Update bulk concentrations of O and R
    for i2 = 2:j-1
        O(i1,i2) = O(i1-1,i2) + DM*(O(i1-1,i2+1)+O(i1-1,i2-1)-2*O(i1-1,i2)) ...
            + km * R(i1-1,i2);

        R(i1,i2) = R(i1-1,i2) + DM*(R(i1-1,i2+1)+R(i1-1,i2-1)-2*R(i1-1,i2)) ...
            - km * R(i1-1,i2);
    end

    % Update current.
    % We flip the sign of current because the Bard and Faulkner current
    % convention is weird
    Z(i1)   = -( kf(i1).*O(i1,2) - kb(i1).*R(i1,2) ) ./ (1 + kf(i1) + kb(i1));
end
~~~~

#### TODO:
- `O(i1,2)` instead of `O(i1,1)`?
- `Z(i1)` twice?

### Plot results

We're done! Plot `eta` vs `Z` to see the final result.
