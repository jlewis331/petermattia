title: "Cyclic Voltammetry App: Tutorial"
---

This tutorial will explain the simulation that powers my simple
cyclic voltammetry MATLAB app.
I built this app to help me better understand simple electrochemistry, and I
hope it helps you too!

Check out a screenshot below:

You can download the app on the
[MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64011-cyclic-voltammetry-simulator)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/petermattia/Cyclic-Voltammetry-Simulator).

Building the app itself was straightforward and fun, thanks to MATLAB's
[App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html).
In this tutorial, however, I'll focus on explaining the electrochemical
simulation itself.
My primary source for these simulations is Appendix B of
[Bard and Faulkner, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition](https://www.amazon.com/Electrochemical-Methods-Fundamentals-Allen-Bard/dp/0471043729).

Equations and discussion will be cross-referenced to Bard and Faulkner,
with links to Wikipedia.

Future goals include an additional tutorial sharing my findings, and porting
this MATLAB app to the web.

Enjoy!
