title: Headspace: Thoughts on mentoring
date: 2017-09-15

I started mentoring my first student, Nick, around this time last year. Nick
was with us for the academic year, working around ~15 hours a week.
We had a lot to do - setting up the hardware, developing analysis software,
catching up on the literature, etc. Since this was a multidisciplinary
collaboration, we had to schedule meetings, book rooms, set up shared accounts,
etc. Additionally, as an industry-sponsored project, we had to frequently
write progress reports and create presentations and posters for the project.

As these requests came up, often without much lead time,
my PI would send them Nick's way, copying me,
and I'd chime in with some specifics on how to get them done.
Nick and I ended up in bureaucratic cycles of drafts and revisions between me and him,
revisions with me and my PI, revisions with me and him again, etc.
This process was slow, but it produced satisfactory results -
and I didn't think too much of it.
Around the same time, I realized the project was moving slower than I thought.
While Nick had a very, very productive year, we definitely shared moments of
frustration over the rate of project progress.
I chalked it up to an ambitious project with a demanding industrial sponsor.

It wasn't until I began mentoring two new undergraduate students this summer
that I realized I had it *completely backwards*.

Students came to our lab to learn science, often with the intent of evaluating
their interest and aptitude for graduate school.
A very real part of doing science is the "meta-science" activities like purchasing,
scheduling, writing reports, etc, but __.
I can do these routine administrative tasks faster than they can, by virtue of
having more time to dedicate to the project and by simply knowing "the system" longer.
So even though these ___

Certainly, every experience is a learning opportunity, but the *value* of
different learning opportunities - scheduling a meeting vs trying a
new characterization technique - is different. Less trivially, writing reports
and other "meta-science" activities can be valuable learning
opportunities - but not at the expense of the actual research.
Additionally, by writing reports, etc myself, I remove a layer of administrative
overhead between my PI and the "content creator".

I made it my mission to take care of most of the "little things"
for the students I mentored, so they have the headspace to focus on their
projects free from distraction.
I asked my PI to route any requests for them to me,
and I started thinking twice before asking them to do something routine.

This summer was incredibly productive - our project progressed by leaps and bounds.
While both of the students I mentored were excellent and would have succeeded
regardless of my role, I like to think that this shift in my mentoring
style at least helped ðŸ˜‰.
