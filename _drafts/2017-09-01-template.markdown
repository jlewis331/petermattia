One of my life goals is to visit all 50 states.
International travel is one thing, but I've always wanted to better understand
this great big crazy country I call home.

I added a map [on this page](/50states) as a way to track my progress.
Excited to add more West Coast states soon!

This also served as a simple exercise in embedding Javascript into my website.
To make this page, I used the free version of the
USA map from [simplemaps.com](http://simplemaps.com/us).
