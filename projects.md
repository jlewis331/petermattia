### Cyclic Voltammetry app and tutorial

I developed a simple MATLAB app for cyclic voltammetry simulations. It's based
on Bard and Faulkner, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Appendix B.
This simulation accounts for a single redox couple, incorporating a
chemical reaction term for the reduced product.
My understanding of cyclic voltammetry deepened tremendously by systematically
exploring different simulation parameters using this app.

You can find a comprehensive tutorial of the simulation
[here](\cyclic_voltammetry_simulation\index.html).

You can find this project online on the [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64011-cyclic-voltammetry-simulator)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/petermattia/Cyclic-Voltammetry-Simulator).
