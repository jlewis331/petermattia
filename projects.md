### Cyclic Voltammetry app and tutorial

I developed simple apps in MATLAB and JavaScript for cyclic voltammetry simulations.
My understanding of cyclic voltammetry deepened tremendously by systematically
exploring different simulation parameters using this app.
I also created [comprehensive tutorials of this simulation](/cyclic_voltammetry_simulation/index.html).
