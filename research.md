Research at Delaware
====================

I worked under [Dr. Joshua Zide](http://www.zidelab.org/) for three years on a novel application of
[thermoelectric materials](http://www.thermoelectrics.caltech.edu/thermoelectrics/index.html). Thermoelectrics are often considered for waste-heat recovery applications, exploiting a steady-state spatial temperature gradient to generate electricity. This project investigated thermoelectric power generation in dynamic temperature environments, or environments with either cyclical or random temperature variations with respect to time. By sandwiching a thermoelectric between two heat exchangers of vastly different thermal masses and placing this device in a dynamic temperature environment, the time-varying temperature of the environment can be converted to small amounts of electrical energy. Some applications of this mechanism include sensors and signals in remote locations such as the desert and tracking large marine wildlife as they pass through oceanic thermoclines. This work is detailed in [Bomberger *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.02.039) and [Attia *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.046).

I also wrote a paper on the ethics of nanotechnology and the environment. Read more at the bottom of [this page](http://www1.udel.edu/researchmagazine/issue/vol4_no2/teamwork.html).

Lastly, I interned with [DuPont](http://www.dupont.com/) Engineering Technologies in the Heat, Mass, and Momentum Transfer group for a summer. I worked on a variety of chemical engineering problems, including water absorption, heat exchanger design, and solid-liquid mixing.
