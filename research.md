Research at Stanford
====================

My research aims to make lithium-ion batteries last longer and charge faster.
I'll provide more details when I've published my work, but my two projects include:
- Studying growth of the
[solid-electrolyte interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Electrolytes),
which , on a model carbon anode
- High-throughput screening of fast-charging policies for commercial cells

Research at Delaware
====================

I worked under [Dr. Joshua Zide](http://www.zidelab.org/) for three years on a novel application of
[thermoelectric materials](http://www.thermoelectrics.caltech.edu/thermoelectrics/index.html).
 Thermoelectrics are often considered for waste-heat recovery applications,
 exploiting a steady-state spatial temperature gradient to generate electricity.
 We investigated thermoelectric power generation in dynamic temperature environments,
 or environments with either cyclical or random temperature variations with respect to time.
 This work is detailed in [Bomberger *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.02.039)
 and [Attia *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.046).

I also wrote a paper on the ethics of nanotechnology and the environment. Read more at the bottom of [this page](http://www1.udel.edu/researchmagazine/issue/vol4_no2/teamwork.html).

Lastly, I interned with [DuPont](http://www.dupont.com/) Engineering Technologies in the Heat, Mass, and Momentum Transfer group for a summer. I worked on a variety of chemical engineering problems, including water absorption, heat exchanger design, and solid-liquid mixing.
