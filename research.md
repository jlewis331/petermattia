Research at Stanford
====================

I work with [Prof. William Chueh](http://chuehlab.stanford.edu) on
**making lithium-ion batteries last longer** and **charge faster.**
More technically, I use electrochemical characerization to study
how surface effects impact the side reactions and rate capability
of carbon anodes.
I'll provide more details when I've published my work, but my main projects include:
- Studying the growth of the
[solid-electrolyte interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Electrolytes),
which is one of the largest sources of degradation in lithium-ion batteries
- High-throughput screening of fast-charging policies for commercial cells

Research at Delaware
====================

I worked with [Dr. Joshua Zide](http://www.zidelab.org/) for three years on a novel application of
[thermoelectric materials](http://www.thermoelectrics.caltech.edu/thermoelectrics/index.html).
 Thermoelectrics are often considered for waste-heat recovery applications,
 exploiting a steady-state spatial temperature gradient to generate electricity.
 We investigated thermoelectric power generation in dynamic temperature environments,
 or environments with either cyclical or random temperature variations with respect to time.
 This work is detailed in [Bomberger *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.02.039)
 and [Attia *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.046).

I also wrote a paper on the ethics of nanotechnology and the environment. Read more at the bottom of [this page](http://www1.udel.edu/researchmagazine/issue/vol4_no2/teamwork.html),
or read the paper [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-012-9422-3).

Lastly, I interned with [DuPont](http://www.dupont.com/) Engineering Technologies in the Heat, Mass, and Momentum Transfer group for a summer. I worked on a variety of chemical engineering problems, including water absorption, heat exchanger design, and solid-liquid mixing.
