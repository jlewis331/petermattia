I’m excited to announce that I’ll be starting at Tesla next week.
The science of climate change is becoming
[clearer and clearer](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1401-2)---
the benefits of reducing our carbon emissions are
[well worth the costs](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw6974).
Transportation contributes [nearly 30%](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions) of carbon emissions in the US,
but its demanding energy density requirements make it
one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

Perhaps more than any other organization,
Tesla got the world excited about decarbonized transportation.
I’m excited to contribute to Tesla’s mission of accelerating the
world's transition to sustainable energy.
