title: Cyclic Voltammetry app tutorial
date: 2017-08-19
---

Recently, I've been learning about fundamental electrochemistry
through my battery research -
charge-transfer vs mass-transfer, reversibility, asymmetry, etc. I found myself
frequently confused by these terms and concepts, without a good resource to
develop my understanding. Of course,
[Bard and Faulkner](https://www.amazon.com/Electrochemical-Methods-Fundamentals-Allen-Bard/dp/0471043729)
is an essential reference for electrochemists, but I've found it a better
reference textbook than a "learning" textbook.

With some help from a post-doc in my lab (who took Allen Bard's
electrochemistry class at UT Austin!),
I built a MATLAB app to help me perform simple electrochemical simulations -
and thus better understand electrochemistry.
Check out a screenshot below:

In the process, I learned about the basics of electrochemistry
and finite element simulations.
I'm working on documentating my code to make simple electrochemical
simulations more accessible.
This will be a work in progress, but you can check it out

As I'm in the middle of writing my own paper, progress may be a bit slower than
desired ;).
