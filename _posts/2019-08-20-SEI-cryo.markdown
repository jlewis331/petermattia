I'm excited to announce that our paper (co-led with
[William Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dt82VI8AAAAJ&hl=en))
was recently [published in *Nano Letters*](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01515)!

This work used cryogenic transmission electron microscopy ("cryo-EM") to visualize
the SEI on carbon electrodes.
Cryo-EM enables atomic-resolution microscopy with minimal air exposure and beam damage.
We found two morphologies of SEI growth: compact SEI (~2 nm) and
extended SEI (~100s of nm), consistent with the SEI literature.
However, we find that instead of observing both morphologies on a single particle,
as was previously hypothesized, these morphologies are present on individual particles.
These results highlight the complexity of the SEI and highlight the power of
cryo-EM as a characterization tool.
