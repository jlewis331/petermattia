I'm excited to announce that our paper (co-led with
[Kristen Severson](https://kseverso.github.io))
on using machine learning to predict battery lifetime
was recently published in [*Nature Energy*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0356-8)!
This work has been featured by
[Stanford News](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/03/25/ai-accurately-predicts-useful-life-batteries/) and
[*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01138-1).

The two most significant highlights of this work include:
- Releasing the largest publicly available battery dataset to date
(available [here](https://data.matr.io/1))
- Achieving ~10% prediction error using machine learning models
and rationalizing their performance

This is just the tip of the iceberg - more to come!
