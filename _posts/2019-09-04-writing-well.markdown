description: Slides from a talk I gave on writing well

One of the skills I've developed most over my graduate school experience is 
technical writing.
For my final group meeting presentation, I gave a talk on best practices for
writing well, focusing on word choice and sentence construction.

This entire talk could be condensed into one four-word rule:
**Make every word count** (or **make every word tell**).
I posted my slides below---I hope they encourage clarity and conciseness
in scientific communication.
