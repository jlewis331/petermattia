I believe

For this reason,

Unlike, say, customer service, science is a perfect field for automation.
Removing the human element from science is an asset!
Autonomation promises higher sample throughput, ,
and a more efficient use of human time.
While I enjoyed making coin cells (mini-batteries for research purposes) when
I joined the lab, the novelty quickly wore off; now, making coin cells is
most definitely work.

I do want to distinguish these  from purely computational approaches like
the [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org).


In this post, I'll discuss three categories of automation in science:
automated **data processing & analysis**, automated **experimentation**,
and automated **everything**.

### Automated data processing & analysis

This is a [analagous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)

In science, we just want one.

Automation enabled by artificial intelligence profiled in
[*Science* magazine](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6346)

### Automated experimentation

**High-throughput testing**

Related field is combinatorics

### Automated everything

**Closed-loop testing**

Well suited for optimization problems
