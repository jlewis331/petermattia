Automation:

I fundementally believe

For this reason,

Unlike, say, customer service, science is a perfect field for automation.
Removing the human element from science is an asset!
Autonomation promises higher sample throughput, ,
and a more efficient use of human time.
While I enjoyed making coin cells (mini-batteries for research purposes) when
I joined the lab, the novelty quickly wore off; now, making coin cells is
most definitely work.

NOT simulations

Three categories: automated processing, automated experimentation,
and automated everything.

### Automated processing & analysis

analagous to data science munging

In science, we just want one.

### Automated experimentation

** High-throughput testing **

### Automated everything

** Closed-loop testing **
