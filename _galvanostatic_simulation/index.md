title: "Galvanostatic simulation tutorials"
description: Tutorials on galvanostatic simulations
---

These tutorials will explain the simulation that powers my simple
galvanostatic apps.
I built these apps to better understand the fundamentals of
electrochemistry, and I hope they help you too!

I originally wrote this simulation in MATLAB and later ported it to JavaScript.
The JavaScript version lives [here](/galvanostatic_simulation/galvanostaticwebapp.html).
You can download the MATLAB version [here](/galvanostatic_simulation/code.html).

My primary source for these simulations is [Bard and Faulkner, *Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications*, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition](https://www.amazon.com/Electrochemical-Methods-Fundamentals-Allen-Bard/dp/0471043729),
Chapter 8.

I also created similar apps and tutorials for
[cyclic voltammetry simulations](/cyclic_voltammetry_simulation/index.html).

Enjoy!
